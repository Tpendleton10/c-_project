# Overview

{As an entry-level software engineer, my goal with this project was to strengthen my understanding of core programming concepts by building a complete turn-based game from scratch in C#. This project allowed me to practice structuring a program, managing game state, and implementing logic that responds to user input.}

{The software is a console-based turn-based game where the player and an opponent take turns performing actions such as attacking or defending. The game continues until one character’s health reaches zero. The program uses classes to represent game entities, loops to control turn flow, and conditional logic to determine outcomes.}

{I created this software to gain hands-on experience with object-oriented programming, control flow, and problem-solving in C#. Building a turn-based game helped me understand how real applications manage state and logic over time, which is essential for future game and application development.}

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a one minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Development Environment

{The software was developed using Visual Studio as the primary development environment. I used the .NET SDK to compile and run the application and relied on the built-in debugger to test logic and fix errors during development.}

{The programming language used for this project was C#. C# was chosen because of its strong support for object-oriented programming, clear syntax, and widespread use in game and application development.}
